# Core variables for Satellite 6.14 -> 6.17 host re-registration project
# Environment: DEVELOPMENT

# ============================================================================
# AAP Integration Guide
# ============================================================================
# This playbook is designed for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) execution.
#
# Required AAP Survey Inputs:
#   satellite_org: Text field, OPTIONAL (see Organization Configuration below)
#
# Required AAP Credentials (attach to job template):
#   1. Satellite API Credential
#      - Type: "Machine" or "Red Hat Satellite 6"
#      - Provides: app_username, app_password
#      - Used for: Satellite 6.14 and 6.17 API calls
#
#   2. Machine Credential (Customer Hosts)
#      - Type: "Machine"
#      - Provides: ansible_user, ansible_password (or ansible_ssh_private_key_file)
#      - Used for: SSH access to RHEL hosts being re-registered
#      - Note: AAP automatically injects these variables - no manual configuration needed
#
# Recommended AAP Job Template Settings (for orgs with 1000+ hosts):
#   - Forks: 5-10
#   - Job Slicing: 100-200 hosts per slice
#   - Enable Concurrent Execution: Yes
#   - Enable Privilege Escalation: Yes (required for subscription-manager)
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# Satellite Server Configuration
# ============================================================================
old_satellite_fqdn: "614satellite.example.com"
new_satellite_fqdn: "617satellite.example.com"
old_satellite_server_url: "https://{{ old_satellite_fqdn }}"
new_satellite_server_url: "https://{{ new_satellite_fqdn }}"

# ============================================================================
# Satellite API Credentials
# ============================================================================
# These are injected by the AAP Satellite API credential attached to the job template
satellite_setup_username: "{{ app_username }}"
satellite_initial_admin_password: "{{ app_password }}"

# ============================================================================
# Organization Configuration
# ============================================================================
# The satellite_org variable determines which organization's hosts to migrate.
# You can provide this value in TWO ways:
#
# OPTION 1: Managed Organization (Pre-Defined)
#   - Best for: Large organizations with recurring migrations
#   - Configuration: Uncomment and set satellite_org below
#   - AAP Usage: Leave survey blank when launching job
#   - Example: Uncomment the line below for EO_ITRA
#
# OPTION 2: Ad-Hoc Organization (Survey Input)
#   - Best for: One-time migrations or testing
#   - Configuration: Keep satellite_org commented out below
#   - AAP Usage: Provide organization name via survey when launching job
#   - Example: Enter "EO_TEST" in survey field
#
# NOTE: If you provide a survey value, it will ALWAYS override the value below.
#       This allows testing different orgs even when a default is set.
#
# AAP Survey Configuration Required:
#   Question: satellite_org
#   Answer Variable Name: satellite_org
#   Answer Type: Text
#   Required: No  ← MUST be set to optional
#   Default Value: (leave blank)
# ============================================================================

# Uncomment ONE of these for managed organizations, or leave all commented for ad-hoc:
# satellite_org: "EO_ITRA"
# satellite_org: "EO_NAVAIR"
# satellite_org: "EO_SPAWAR"

# Default location for all hosts in Satellite 6.17
satellite_location: "default_location"

# Lifecycle environment naming convention: {ORG}_ALL
new_default_env: "{{ satellite_org }}_ALL"

# ============================================================================
# Host Filtering Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Hosts to EXCLUDE from export and re-registration
# 
# Use Cases:
#   - Capsule servers (should not be re-registered as regular hosts)
#   - Satellite servers (old and new)
#   - Infrastructure hosts that should remain on old Satellite
#   - Test/development hosts that should be skipped
#
# How it works:
#   1. Playbook exports all hosts from Satellite 6.14
#   2. Filters out any hostnames in this list
#   3. Only remaining hosts are added to migration inventory
#
# IMPORTANT: Update this list with your actual capsule and satellite hostnames!
excluded_hostnames:
  - "capsule01.example.com"
  - "capsule02.example.com"
  - "capsule03.example.com"
  - "satellite614.example.com"  # Old Satellite server
  - "satellite617.example.com"  # New Satellite server

# Alternative Pattern-Based Filtering (Optional):
# If you prefer regex patterns instead of explicit hostnames, you can use:
#   excluded_hostname_patterns:
#     - "^capsule.*"              # Any hostname starting with "capsule"
#     - "^satellite.*"            # Any hostname starting with "satellite"
#     - ".*\\.infra\\..*"         # Any hostname with .infra. in FQDN
#
# NOTE: Pattern-based filtering requires additional code in export_hosts role.
#       The simple hostname list above is recommended for most use cases.

# ============================================================================
# Host SSH Authentication
# ============================================================================
# Credentials are automatically injected by AAP Machine Credential.
# No configuration needed here - AAP provides:
#   - ansible_user (username for SSH connections)
#   - ansible_password (if password-based auth) OR
#   - ansible_ssh_private_key_file (if key-based auth)
#   - ansible_become (for privilege escalation)
#
# To configure in AAP:
#   1. Resources > Credentials > Add
#   2. Credential Type: Machine
#   3. Username: root (or customer-provided username)
#   4. Password OR SSH Private Key (customer-provided)
#   5. Privilege Escalation Method: sudo
#   6. Attach credential to job template

# ============================================================================
# Activation Keys by RHEL Major Version
# ============================================================================
# These activation keys must already exist in Satellite 6.17
# Create them via: Content > Activation Keys
# 
# NOTE: Key names must match the pattern expected by the playbook.
#       If your keys use different naming, update the values below.
activation_keys:
  rhel-6: "rhel-6"
  rhel-7: "rhel-7"
  rhel-8: "rhel-8"
  rhel-9: "rhel-9"

# ============================================================================
# Python Interpreter
# ============================================================================
ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3

# ============================================================================
# Capsule Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Smart Proxy IDs for round-robin registration distribution
# 
# How to find Capsule IDs in Satellite 6.17:
#   1. Navigate to: Infrastructure > Capsules
#   2. Click on a capsule name
#   3. Look at the URL: https://satellite.example.com/smart_proxies/123
#   4. The number at the end (123) is the smart_proxy_id
#
# The playbook will automatically distribute hosts across these capsules
# using round-robin assignment to balance the load.
#
# Example: With 3 capsules and 100 hosts:
#   - Host 1, 4, 7, 10... → Capsule 1
#   - Host 2, 5, 8, 11... → Capsule 2
#   - Host 3, 6, 9, 12... → Capsule 3
#
# IMPORTANT: These are NEW capsule IDs from Satellite 6.17
#            (Not the old capsules being filtered out above)
smart_proxy_ids:
  - 1  # Replace with actual capsule ID from Satellite 6.17
  - 2  # Replace with actual capsule ID from Satellite 6.17
  - 3  # Replace with actual capsule ID from Satellite 6.17

# Content download policy for registered hosts
capsule_download_policy: "on_demand"

# ============================================================================
# Logging Configuration
# ============================================================================
# All registration activities are logged to this file on the AAP control node
# Log includes: host exports, registration success/failure, capsule assignments
registration_log_path: "/var/log/aap_satellite_reregistration.log"

# ============================================================================
# Execution Control
# ============================================================================
# batch_size: Number of hosts to process in each serial batch
# 
# How it works:
#   - Playbook processes hosts in batches (not all at once)
#   - Each batch must complete before the next batch starts
#   - Within a batch, hosts run in parallel (controlled by AAP forks setting)
#
# Tuning recommendations:
#   Small orgs  (< 100 hosts):   batch_size: 25
#   Medium orgs (100-500 hosts): batch_size: 50  ← Default
#   Large orgs  (500+ hosts):    batch_size: 100
#
# Example: 200 hosts with batch_size=50
#   Batch 1: Hosts 1-50   (all complete)
#   Batch 2: Hosts 51-100 (all complete)
#   Batch 3: Hosts 101-150 (all complete)
#   Batch 4: Hosts 151-200 (all complete)
#
# Benefits of batching:
#   - Controlled load on Satellite/Capsule infrastructure
#   - Early failure detection (catch issues in first batch)
#   - Better progress visibility in AAP
#   - Prevents overwhelming API with simultaneous requests
batch_size: 50
